This is a small dice game I am using to refresh some javascript fundamentals.

Play it at https://jmpann.github.io/pig_dice_game/



GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he or she wants. Each result will be get added to his or her ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game


Design Guidelines:






Stretch Features:


1. A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
2. Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100.
3. Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1.

New Project Idea:

1. Recreate this game using React.js library.
