This is a small dice game I am using to refresh some javascript fundamentals



GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he or she wants. Each result will be get added to his or her ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
